Last month I asked my group chat what date was¬†*too*¬†late to open work conversations with "Happy New Year." Most said January 15th. No one said anything close to February 2nd/3rd but here we are...¬†Happy New Year! üéâ It‚Äôs been awhile since I‚Äôve last seen you, and there‚Äôs lots to share.¬†Read on for the latest in dbt Cloud + new tools and resources.

## **What's new**

*What you might have missed this quarter*

- **[dbt utils v1.0 is live](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/migration/versions/upgrading-to-dbt-utils-v1.0).** Pay close attention to the changes in surrogate key generation, and don‚Äôt miss [this developer blog post](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/grouping-data-tests) from dbt utils contributor Emily Riederer discussing the new ability to run grouped checks.
- **[dbt-databricks adapter is now available in dbt Cloud](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/migration/tools/migrating-from-spark-to-databricks#migration)**. The new adapter that dropped in November is easier to set up, has better defaults for developing on Databricks, and supports Unity Catalog (on dbt v1.1+).
- **[dbt natively supports Python.](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/introducing-support-for-python/)** As of October, you can deploy Python models alongside your SQL ones, enjoying a single view of lineage across both.

## **What's Better?**

- **[The new dbt Cloud IDE](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/new-improved-cloud-ide/)** is live, and available to everyone. It‚Äôs faster, more intuitive, and includes some neat quality-of-life features like git diff view, autocomplete, a code formatter, and an improved syntax highlighting.
- **[Custom node colors in the dbt DAG](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/announcing-dbt-v1.3-and-utils/).** Color coding your DAG makes it *much* easier to understand your project at a glance. Read about this update, as well as other dbt Core v1.3 improvements.
- **[New Service Bundles](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/revamped-professional-services):** The dbt Labs Pro Services team is re-launching its services offerings with new bundles and engagement models, making it simpler for customers to find an engagement scope that works for them.
- **Removing defaults:** ‚ÄúRun on schedule‚Äù is no longer the default setting when creating a new job definition in the dbt Cloud UI. No more accidentally scheduled jobs + unwanted runs.
