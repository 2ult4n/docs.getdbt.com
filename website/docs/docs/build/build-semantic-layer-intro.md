Seamlessly your semantic layer using [semantic models](/docs/build/semantic-models) and [metrics](/docs/build/metrics-overview) with concepts you're already familiar with using dbt metrics, powered by MetricFlow.

These sections assume you use dbt with the [command line (CLI)](/docs/core/about-the-cli), and explain how you can use MetricFlow to define your metrics and [semantic graph](/docs/build/metricflow-core-concepts#semantic-graph), as well as provide data governance over how company metrics are defined and managed. 

:::tip Use MetricFlow with CLI
Currently, you can can define metrics using the [dbt and MetricFlow spec](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/discussions/7456). Weâ€™re working with integration partners to release a beta of integrations and you can currently query MetricFlow using the CLI. We're working to introduce other consumption methods like Python and JDBC.
