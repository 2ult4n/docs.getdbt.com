### Browser sessions

A session is a period of time during which youâ€™re signed in to a dbt Cloud account from a browser. dbt Cloud will not automatically log you out after a set time. However, once you close your browser, you end your dbt Cloud session. This action logs you out and you'll need to re-login the next time you try to access dbt Cloud. 

If you've logged in using [SSO](/docs/cloud/manage-access/sso-overview) or [OAuth](/docs/cloud/manage-access/set-up-snowflake-oauth), you can customize your session time, which may vary depending on your identity provider (IdP).
