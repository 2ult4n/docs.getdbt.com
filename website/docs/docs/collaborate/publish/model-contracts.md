## Why define a contract?

Defining a dbt model is as easy as writing a SQL `select` statement, or a Python Data Frame transformation. Your query naturally produces a dataset with columns of names and types, based on the columns you're selecting and the transformations you're applying.

While this is great for quick & iterative development, for some models, constantly changing the shape of the model's returned dataset poses a risk, when there are other people and processes querying that model. It's better to define a set of **upfront guarantees** about the shape of your model. We call this set of guarantees a "contract." While building your model, dbt will verify that your model's transformation will produce a dataset matching up with its contractâ€”or it will fail to build.

## How to define a contract

Let's say you have a model with a query like:

<File name="models/marts/dim_customers.sql">

```sql
-- lots of SQL

final as (

    select
        -- lots of columns
    from ...

)

select * from final
```
</File>

Your contract **must** include every column's `name` and `data_type` (where `data_type` matches the type understood by your data platform). If your model is being materialized as `table` or `incremental`, you may optionally specify that certain columns must be `not_null` (i.e. contain zero null values). Depending on your data platform, you may also be able to define additional `constraints` that are enforced while the model is being built.

Finally, you configure your model with `contract: true`.

<File name="models/marts/customers.yml">

```yaml
models:
  - name: dim_customers
    config:
      contract: true
    columns:
      - name: customer_id
        data_type: int
        not_null: true
      - name: customer_name
        data_type: string
        ...
```

</File>

When building a model with a defined contract, dbt will do two things differently:
1. dbt will run a "pre-flight" check to ensure that the model's query will return a set of columns with names and data types matching the ones you have defined.
2. dbt will pass the column names, types, `not_null` and other constraints into the DDL statements it submits to the data platform, where they will be enforced while building the table.

## FAQs

### Which models should have contracts?

Any model can define a contract. It's especially important to define contracts for "public" models that are being shared with other groups, teams, and (soon) dbt projects.

### How are contracts different from tests?

A model's contract defines the **shape** of the returned dataset.

[Tests](tests) are a more flexible mechanism for validating the content of your model. So long as you can write the query, you can run the test. Tests are also more configurable, via `severity` and custom thresholds, and easier to debug after finding failures, because the model has already built, and the relevant records can be materialized in the data warehouse by [storing failures](resource-configs/store_failures).

In blue/green deployments (docs link TK), ... <!-- TODO write more here -->

In the parallel for software APIs:
- The structure of the API response is the contract
- Quality and reliability ("uptime") are also **crucial**, but not part of the contract per se.
