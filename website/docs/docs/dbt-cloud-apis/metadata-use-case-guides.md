Use the Metadata API to solve the following use cases:

- **Discovery*** &mdash; Find and understand dbt assets to analyze in integrated tools using information like model and metric definitions, column info, and lineage. One example of this is the [dbt Semantic Layer integration](/guides/dbt-ecosystem/sl-partner-integration-guide). 
- **Quality*** &mdash; Make sure users have correct and up-to-date data for their analyses by monitoring test failures, source freshness, run status, exposures, and dependencies.
- **Operations*** &mdash;  Help data teams run dbt efficiently and reduce costs by using historical run data, including information like model build time and run counts.
 

Users may use the API directly or within an integrated tool, and it powers some experiences in dbt Cloud itself. Many Metadata API use cases also benefit from [webhooks](/docs/deploy/webhooks) to access the most up-to-date project and run information.
