This section provides an overview of the deployment types available with specific dbt Cloud plans.

In general, the dbt Cloud application deployment models fall into two categories: **Multi Tenant** and **Single Tenant**. These deployments are hosted on infrastructure managed by dbt Labs. The Multi Tenant model leverages AWS infrastructure as described in the [Architecture](deployment-architecture) section. 

The Single Tenant model can be deployed to AWS or Azure infrastructure managed by dbt Labs. The Single Tenant model is only available with dbt Labs' Virtual Private dbt plan. All other plans leverage the Multi Tenant model. Contact us at sales@getdbt.com to discuss the best plan for your requirements.
