:::tip Keep on latest version, always

_Is it dbt Core? Is it dbt Cloud? From now on, it's just dbt._

Starting this year, let dbt Labs handle version upgrades for you. With dbt Cloud, you can get early access to new functionality before it lands in the final release of dbt Core v1.8 and without the need of managing your own version upgrades. For more details, refer to [Upgrade Core version in Cloud](/docs/dbt-versions/upgrade-core-in-cloud).

The **Keep on latest version** setting is currently available in beta for select dbt Cloud customers. The first beta release of dbt-core v1.8 is planned for February 28.
