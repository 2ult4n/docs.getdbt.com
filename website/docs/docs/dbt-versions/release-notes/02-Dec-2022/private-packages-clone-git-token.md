The supported way for cloning private packages is using the [git clone method](/docs/build/packages#git-token-method), in which an appropriate token is passed into the package repository URL via an environment variable. 

There is a small user base that has been able to clone private GitHub packages using our native GitHub application without explicitly providing an access token. We are deprecating this functionality, as itâ€™s limited in flexibility. 

If you have been using a package hosted in a private repository on GitHub, you must explicitly pass as access token into the URL going forward. See below for sample usage.

```yaml

packages:
- git: "https://{{env_var('DBT_ENV_SECRET_GIT_CREDENTIAL')}}@github.com/dbt-labs/awesome_repo.git"

```
