dbt Cloud is the easiest and most reliable way to develop and deploy a dbt project. It helps remove complexity all while delivering more power. We’re thrilled to now offer a simpler Databricks connection experience with support for Databricks’ Unity Catalog and better modeling defaults.

This is great news for the hundreds of Databricks customers already using dbt Cloud with the dbt-spark adapter, as they can now [migrate](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/migration/tools/migrating-from-spark-to-databricks#migration) their connection to the [dbt-databricks adapter](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/warehouse-setups/databricks-setup) to unlock the benefits. The [Databricks team](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2022/11/17/introducing-native-high-performance-integration-dbt-cloud.html) is committed to maintaining and improving the adapter over time, so you can be sure the integrated experience will provide the best of dbt and the best of Databricks.
