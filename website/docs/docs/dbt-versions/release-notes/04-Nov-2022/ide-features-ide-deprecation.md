## Introducing additional IDE features 

The new version of the Cloud IDE has launched four brand-new additional features, making it easier and faster for you to develop in the IDE.

The new additional features are:

- **Formatting** &mdash; Format your files with a click of a button, powered by sqlfmt.
- **Git diff view** &mdash; Ability to see what has been changed in a file before you make a pull request.
- **dbt autocomplete** &mdash; There are four new types of autocomplete features to help you develop faster:
    - Use ref to autocomplete your model names
    - Use source to autocomplete your source name + table name
    - Use macro to autocomplete your arguments
    - Use env var to autocomplete env var
- **Dark mode**	&mdash;  Use dark mode in the Cloud IDE for a great viewing experience in low-light environments.

## Classic IDE deprecation notice

In December 2022, the classic IDE will be deprecated in favor of the [new and refreshed IDE](/docs/get-started/develop-in-the-cloud) for _all_ dbt Cloud users. You will no longer be able to use the classic IDE and dbt Labs may introduce changes that break the classic IDE.
