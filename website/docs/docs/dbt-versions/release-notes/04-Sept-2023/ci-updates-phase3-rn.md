Temporary schemas are now being deleted (dropped) for all adapters (like Databricks), PrivateLink connections, and environment variables in connection strings. 

dbt Labs has rearchitected how schema deletion works for [continuous integration (CI)](/docs/deploy/continuous-integration) runs. We created a new service to delete any schema with a prefix of `dbt_cloud_pr` that's been generated by a PR run.

However, temporary schemas will not be automatically deleted if:
- Your project overrides the `generate_schema_name` macro but it doesn't contain the prefix `dbt_cloud_pr`. 
- You're using a [non-native Git integration](/docs/deploy/ci-jobs#trigger-a-ci-job-with-the-api). This is because automatic deletion relies on incoming webhooks from Git providers, which is only available through the native integrations.
