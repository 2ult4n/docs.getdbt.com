- Now using Spotlight for improved UI and UX.
- All endpoints are now documented for v2 and v3. Added automation to the docs so they remain up to date.  
- Many of the request and response bodies are documented
- You can now test endpoints directly from with the API docs pages
- With the new UI, you can more easily generate code for any endpoint
