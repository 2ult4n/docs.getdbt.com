The new **Deployment Monitor** page helps you gain greater visibility into your deployment health and quickly detect any issues with the improved filtering and sorting capabilities. You can prioritize and customize the view based on the environment, such as **Production** from the dropdown menu at the top right of the page.

Use prefiltered **In Progress** and **In Queue** views to track relevant activities and stay up-to-date on your deployment status.

The **Deployment Monitor** is accessible from the main dbt Cloud dashboard page or by clicking the dbt logo on the upper-left. Some of the new and enhanced features include:

- A new run history visualization component to quickly scan a larger number of recent runs and get a better overview of overall health/activity.
- Prefiltered lists have been added to display **In Progress**, **In Queue**, and **Latest Failed** jobs. 
- Filter the page by environment, with the preference being stored for future use. 
- The visualization at the top of the page now filters runs by trigger and displays the last 24 hours of runs, with a limit of 500.
