dbt Cloud no longer supports versions less than 1.0. We removed old versions of dbt from dbt Cloud on March 1, 2023, and any environments or jobs configured to run a dbt version less than 1.0 were automatically upgraded to the latest minor version of dbt available in dbt Cloud â€“ dbt 1.4. 

For more info on dbt versions, releases, and dbt Cloud support timeline, refer to [About dbt Core versions](/docs/dbt-versions/core#latest-releases).
