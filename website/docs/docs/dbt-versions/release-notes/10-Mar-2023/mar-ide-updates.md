To continue improving our [Cloud IDE](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/develop-in-the-cloud) experience, the dbt Labs team worked on fixing bugs, increasing reliability, and adding new features âœ¨.

Read more about the [upcoming improvements to the Cloud IDE](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/improvements-to-the-dbt-cloud-ide/) and stay up-to-date with [IDE-related changes](https://docs.getdbt.com/tags/ide).


## New features 

- The Version Control feature now allows you to commit and revert individual files.
- You can now use the command palette to invoke common complex dbt commands, such as resuming from the last failure.
- Under the git dropdown, you can now create PRs even when there are uncommitted changes.
- You will now see more autocomplete suggestions when editing a YML file; this is powered by [dbt-jsonschema](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-jsonschema).
- The file tree now has additional options in the right-click menu, such as Copy model as ref or Copy file path.
- The DAG view has been adjusted to a default of `2+model+2`.
- A lineage selector has been implemented in the DAG/lineage sub-tab.
- You can now edit directly in the git diff view, located in the right pane.
- A warning message will now appear when users press Command-W/Control-W when there are unsaved changes.
- A new onboarding flow guide is now available.

## Product refinements 

- The DAG selector now uses `name` instead of `file_uri` to build selectors.
- The DAG is now vertically centered under the new Selector Input element 
- sqlfmt has been upgraded to v0.17.0.
- When the Format button fails, a toast notification will display a syntax error.
- The editor now has the option to toggle minimap/word-wrap via right-click.
- The history drawer now displays elapsed time more in real-time and in s/m/h increments.
- When deleting development environments, the delete modal will now warn users that any uncommitted changes will be lost.
- The context for the Git button has been adjusted to show that it will link to an external site (such as GitHub or GitLab) when users create a pull request.

## Bug fixes

- The IDE now displays an error message when the git repository is not reachable. Previously, it failed silently.
- On small screens, the **Split** button is now hidden.
- The kebab menu is now visible when the invocation history drawer is open. Previously, it wasn't showing.

- The IDE no longer has issues with single-space file names.
- Adding invalid characters in the sub-directory config no longer causes the IDE to fail.
- YML schema validation now consistently passes. Previously, it failed occasionally.
