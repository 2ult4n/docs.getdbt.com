dbt Labs has deprecated dbt Metrics and the legacy dbt Semantic Layer, both supported on dbt version 1.5 or lower. These changes will be in effect on _December 15th, 2023_.

This deprecation means dbt Metrics and the legacy Semantic Layer will no longer be supported. We will also remove the product from the dbt Cloud user interface and [documentation site](https://docs.getdbt.com/).

### Why this change?

We understand that changes of this nature can be disruptive and we believe in the potential of the new direction. The [re-released dbt Semantic Layer](/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/dbt-sl), powered by MetricFlow, is a significantly improved foundation that enables more flexible query generation, faster performance, and a more dynamic consumption experience. Itâ€™s a step towards a brighter future for dbt and its community.

### Key changes

- Legacy Semantic Layer and dbt Metrics will officially be deprecated on December 15th, 2023.
- MetricFlow has replaced dbt Metrics for the construction of semantic logic. The `dbt_metrics` package will no longer be supported.
- Exports replaces Materializations. Exports will be available in December or January in dbt Cloud and replaces the previous materializations functionality.

### Actions 

- If you're using the legacy dbt Semantic Layer or dbt Metrics, use the [dbt Semantic Layer migration guide](/guides/sl-migration?step=1) to migrate over to the re-released dbt Semantic Layer.
- Engage and share feedback with the dbt Labs team and dbt Community slack using channels like [#dbt-cloud-semantic-layer](https://getdbt.slack.com/archives/C046L0VTVR6) and [#dbt-metricflow](https://getdbt.slack.com/archives/C02CCBBBR1D). Or reach out to your dbt Cloud account representative.
