On December 15th, 2023, dbt Labs deprecated dbt Metrics and the legacy dbt Semantic Layer, both supported on dbt version 1.5 or lower. This deprecation means dbt Metrics and the legacy Semantic Layer will no longer be supported. We will also remove the product from the dbt Cloud user interface and [documentation site](https://docs.getdbt.com/).

To access the [re-released dbt Semantic Layer](/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/dbt-sl), switch to the latest version using the dedicated [migration guide](/guides/sl-migration?step=1).
