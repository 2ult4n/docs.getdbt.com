Manage, set up, and automate your dbt jobs with robust control over job settings and execution in production. You can use the job scheduler to configure when and how your jobs run. Managing your jobs with dbt Cloud allows you to:

- [Create and schedule jobs](/docs/deploy/job-settings) &mdash; Intuitively navigate the user interface to create new dbt jobs or edit existing ones.
- [Setup job commands](/docs/deploy/job-commands) &mdash; Use job commands to configure dbt commands on a schedule.
- [Configure and run your jobs](/docs/deploy/job-triggers) &mdash; You can configure when and how dbt should run your job, including:
	* Running on scheduled days or cron schedule, 
	* Setting up continuous integration (CI) to run when someone opens a new pull request in your dbt repository
	* Using the API to trigger jobs.  

The docs in this section provide detailed information required for configuring and managing your dbt jobs in dbt Cloud.
