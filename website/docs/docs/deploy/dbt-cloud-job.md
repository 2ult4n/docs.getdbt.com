With dbt Cloud's in-app scheduling, logging, and alerting features, you can easily build observability into your processes.

With dbt Cloud, you can:

- Effortlessly run and customize your jobs on a schedule 
- Keep your data pipelines running smoothly
- Easily access logs from previous invocations of dbt
- Set up error notifications to stay informed and in control
- Automate workflows by using [Webhooks in dbt Cloud](/docs/deploy/webhooks) to send events (notifications) about your dbt jobs to your other systems like Slack, PagerDuty, and so on
- Plus, with the ability to render your project's documentation, you can streamline your team's collaboration and productivity
