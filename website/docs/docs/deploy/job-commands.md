A dbt Cloud job is a set of commands and configurations that help you to run it on a schedule and carry out a project task. A job will generally include the following:

- Job name understood by yourself or peers
- Set of guidelines, like dbt version, target name, number of [threads](/docs/get-started/connection-profiles#understanding-threads)
- Optional job-level [environmental variables](/docs/build/environment-variables)
- Configurable [dbt commands](/reference/dbt-commands), including [built-in commands](#command-types)
- Option to defer to a [deployment environment](/docs/collaborate/environments/dbt-cloud-environments#types-of-environments)
- Job triggers, like an optional schedule, continuous integration, and API

## Prerequisites

To successfully configure job commands, you'll need to have the following already set up:

- A dbt Cloud account with an active dbt project connected to a data platform and git provider
- [Permission](/docs/collaborate/manage-access/about-access) to create, edit, and run jobs
- A configured job and production environment 

## Command types

Commands are specific tasks you set in your dbt Cloud jobs.  Jobs come with built-in commands and you can also configure [certain dbt commands](/reference/dbt-commands), which are executed by the job. 

- **Built-in commands** &mdash; Every job invocation includes [`dbt deps`](/reference/commands/deps), meaning you don't need to add it to the **Commands** list in your job settings. `dbt deps` pulls the most recent version of the dependencies listed in your packages.yml from git.

- **Checkbox commands** &mdash; Every job includes the option to select the [**Generate docs on run**](/docs/collaborate/build-and-view-your-docs) or [**Run on source freshness**](/docs/deploy/source-freshness) checkboxes. These enable you to generate project docs or enable source freshness automatically. 

- **Commands list** &mdash; Every job gives you the option to configure and add [dbt commands](/reference/dbt-commands), under the **Execution Settings** --> **Commands** section of the job settings.  You need to have at least one dbt command and can add as many as necessary.

    USe [selectors](/reference/node-selection/syntax) as a powerful way to select and execute portions of your project in a job run. If a selector doesn't match any models, the job run won't consider it a failure. For example, to run tests for one_specific_model, use the selector: `dbt test --select one_specific_model`

     - IF THE SELECTOR DOESN'T MATCH NODES, WILL IT BE CONSIDERED? CANCELLED? CAN YOU PROVIDE AN EXAMPLE? NEED MORE INFO

## How commands interact

During a job run, the commands are ‚Äúchained‚Äù together. This means if one of the commands in the chain fails, then the next ones aren't executed. 

For example:

- `dbt command 1` ‚úÖ
- `dbt command 2` ‚úÖ
- `dbt command 3` ‚ùå¬†- fails
- `dbt command 4` üö´¬†- skipped
- `dbt command 5` üö´¬†- skipped

In this example, if `dbt command 3` fails, then the subsequent commands aren't executed, and the entire job fails. The failed job returns an [exit code](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/exit-codes) and "Error" job status. 

## Troubleshooting

Job failures can mean different things for different commands. Here are some reasons why a job may fail:

- **`dbt run` fail** &mdash; [`dbt run`](/reference/commands/run) executes compiled sql model files against the current target database. It will fail if there is an error in any of the built models. 

    * If a [`select`](/reference/node-selection/set-operators) matches multiple nodes and one of the nodes fails, then the job will have an exit code `1` and the subsequent command will fail. If you specified the [`‚Äîfail-fast`](/reference/global-configs#failing-fast) flag, then the first failure will stop the entire connection for any models that are in-progress. 

    * TODO what is the exit code for a partial fail?

    * Tests on upstream resources prevent downstream resources from running and a failed test will skip them.

- **`dbt test` fail** &mdash; [`dbt test`](/reference/commands/test) runs tests defined on models, sources, snapshots, and seeds. A test can pass, fail, or warn depending on its [configuration](/reference/test-configs). Only an error stops the next step.

- **`dbt build` fail** &mdash; [`dbt build`](/reference/commands/build) runs models, tests, snapshots, and seeds. NEED MORE INFO ON THIS - what info do you want to convey?
