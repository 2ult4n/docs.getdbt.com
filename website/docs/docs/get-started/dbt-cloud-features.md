## dbt Cloud IDE

:::info ðŸ“Œ

The new and refreshed Cloud IDE will be open to General Availability by end of October 2022. The new Cloud IDE and includes performance upgrades, ergonomics improvements, and some delightful enhancements! Review the [new Cloud IDE features](#ide-features) and check out [Nate's blog link](URL) to stay up to date with any new enhancements.

:::

The dbt Cloud [integrated development environment (IDE)](/docs/get-started/develop-in-the-cloud) allows you to build, test, run, and version control your dbt projects directly from your browser. The IDE is the fastest and most reliable way to deploy dbt, and provides a real-time editing and execution environment for your dbt project -- no command line required.  Anyone can use the IDE, from new dbt developers to seasoned practitioners.

With the Cloud IDE, you can:

- Write modular SQL models with `select` statements and the [ref()](/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/ref) function.
- Compile dbt code into SQL and execute it against your database directly.
- Test every model before deploying them to production.
- Generate and view documentation of your dbt project.
- Leverage [git and version-control your code](/docs/collaborate/git/version-control-basics) from your browser with a couple of clicks.
- Create and test Python models:
    * You can `compile` Python models to see the full function that gets executed in your data platform
    * You can see Python models in DAG in dbt version 1.3 and higher
       * You cannot preview python models currently.
- Visualize a directed acyclic graph (DAG), [and more](/docs/get-started/dbt-cloud-tips).
