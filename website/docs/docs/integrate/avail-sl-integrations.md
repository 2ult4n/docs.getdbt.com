# Available integrations

Extend the analytics engineering workflow beyond dbt Cloud with seamless integrations covering a range of use cases across the Modern Data Stack. 

The dbt Semantic Layer brings a wide range of partners you can integrate and query with, including BI tools, Notebooks, ML models, and Data apps.  Our partner integrations will unlock a world of self-service and consistent metric reporting in integration tools. 

There are two categories of Partner integrations: 

1. **dbt Semantic Layer partners** - This refers to a group of dbt Labs partners who have full end-to-end integrations with the dbt Semantic Layer and leverage the dbt Server. 
2. **dbt metrics ready partners** - This refers to all partners integrating with dbt metrics functionality but doesnâ€™t leverage the dbt Server.
