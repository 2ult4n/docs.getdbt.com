# Available integrations

The dbt Semantic Layer brings a wide range of partners you can integrate and query with, including BI tools, Notebooks, ML models, and Data apps. Get ready to extend the analytics engineering workflow beyond dbt Cloud, with seamless integrations covering a range of use cases across the Modern Data Stack. 

There are two categories of partner integrations: 

&mdash; **dbt Semantic Layer partners** - This refers to a group of dbt Labs partners who have full end-to-end integrations with the dbt Semantic Layer and leverage the dbt Server. 

&mdash; **dbt metrics ready partners** - This refers to all partners integrating with dbt metrics functionality but do not leverage the dbt Server.

For information on the different integration partners, their documention and more, review our [dbt Semantic Layer integrations](https://www.getdbt.com/product/semantic-layer-integrations) page.
