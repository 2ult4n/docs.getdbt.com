:::info üìå

The dbt Semantic Layer is currently available for public preview! With the dbt Semantic Layer, you'll be able to centrally define business metrics, remove code duplication and inconsistency, create self-service in downstream tools, and more! 

For more info on public preview and plan availability, check out the [public preview](/docs/integrate/dbt-semantic-layer#public-preview) and [product architecture](/docs/integrate/dbt-semantic-layer#product-architecture) section.
    
:::

The dbt Semantic Layer allows data teams to centrally define essential business metrics like¬†`revenue`,¬†`customer`, and `churn` in the modeling layer (your dbt project) for consistent self-service within downstream data tools like BI and metadata management solutions.

The result? You have less duplicative coding for data teams and more consistency for data consumers. The dbt Semantic Layer has four main parts:

- Define your metrics in version-controlled dbt project code
- Import your metric definitions via the [Metadata API](/docs/dbt-cloud/dbt-cloud-api/metadata/metadata-querying)
- Query your metric data via the dbt Proxy Server
- Explore and analyze dbt metrics in downstream tools

**What makes the dbt Semantic Layer different?**

The dbt Semantic Layer removes code duplication and inconsistency when it comes to your business metrics. By moving metric definitions out of the BI layer and into the modeling layer, data teams can feel confident that different business units are working from the same data definitions, regardless of their tool of choice. If a metric definition changes in dbt, it‚Äôs refreshed everywhere it‚Äôs invoked and creates consistency across all applications.


## Prerequisites
To use the dbt Semantic Layer, you‚Äôll need to meet the following:

- Have a multi-tenant [dbt Cloud](https://cloud.getdbt.com/) Teams or Enterprise account. 
   * Developer accounts will be able to query the Proxy Server using SQL, but will not be able to browse pre-populated dbt metrics in external tools, which requires access to the Metadata API.
- Have both your production and development environments running dbt version 1.2 (latest) or higher
- Use Snowflake data platfrom 
- Install the metrics package version 0.3.2 or higher in your dbt project
- Set up the [Metadata API](/docs/dbt-cloud/dbt-cloud-api/metadata/metadata-overview) in the integrated tool to import metric definitions
- Recommended - Review the dbt metrics page and Getting started with the dbt Semantic Layer blog

### Considerations

Here are some important considerations to know about during public preview:

- Support for Snowflake data platform only (_additional data platforms coming soon_)
- Support for the deployment environment only (_development experience coming soon_)
- Do not use environment variables for the job/environment (_coming soon_)

## Public preview

The dbt Semantic Layer is currently available for public preview, which means:

&mdash; **Who?** The dbt Semantic Layer is open to all dbt Cloud tiers (Developer, Team, and Enterprise) during public preview. Developer accounts will be able to query the Proxy Server using SQL, but will not be able to browse dbt metrics in external tools, which requires access to the Metadata API. 

&mdash; **What?** Public preview provides early access to new features, is supported and production ready, but not priced yet. Pricing for the dbt Semantic Layer will be introduced alongside the General Available (GA) release. There may also still be additions or modifications to product behavior. 

&mdash; **When?** Public preview will end once the dbt Semantic Layer is available for GA. After GA, the dbt Semantic Layer will only be available to dbt Cloud **Team** and **Enterprise** plans.

&mdash; **Where?** Public preview is enabled at the account level so you don‚Äôt need to worry about enabling it per user.

&mdash; **Why?** Public preview is designed to test the functionality and collect feedback from the community on performance, usability, and documentation. 

## Product architecture 

The dbt Semantic Layer product architecture includes four primary components, and you can review that and its plan availability in more detail below:

| Components | Information | Developer plans | Team plans | Enterprise plans | License |
| --- | --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | --- |
| **dbt metrics** | Allows you to define metrics in dbt Core. | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |  ‚úÖ  | Open source, Core |
| **dbt Server**| HTTP server that is able to quickly compile metric queries per environment using dbt project code. | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | BSL |
| **SQL Proxy** | Reverse-proxy that accepts dbt-SQL (SQL + Jinja like query models and metrics, use macros), compiles the query into pure SQL, and executes the query against the data platform. | ‚úÖ <br></br>_* Available during public preview only_ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | Proprietary, Cloud (Team & Enterprise) |
| **Metadata API**  | Accesses metric definitions primarily via integrations and is the source of truth for objects defined in dbt projects (like models, macros, sources, metrics). The Metadata API is updated at the end of every dbt Cloud run. | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | Proprietary, Cloud (Team & Enterprise |

dbt Semantic Layer integrations will:

- Leverage the Metadata API to fetch a list of objects and their attributes, like metrics
- Generate a dbt-SQL statement
- Then query the SQL proxy to evaluate the results of this statement


## Manage metrics

:::info üìå

New to dbt or metrics? Check out our [Getting Started guide](/guides/getting-started) to build your first dbt project! If you'd like to define your first metrics, try our [Jaffle Shop](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop_metrics) example project.

:::

If you're not sure whether to define a metric in dbt or not, ask yourself the following: 

> *Is this something our teams consistently need to report on?*  

An important business metric should be:

- Well-defined (the definition is agreed upon throughout the entire organization)
- Time-bound (able to be compared across time)

A great example of this is **revenue** - it can be aggregated on multiple levels (weekly, monthly, etc) and is key for the broader business to understand:

‚úÖ `Monthly Recurring Revenue` or `Weekly Active Users` or `Average Order Value`
‚ùå `1-off experimental metric`

**dbt metrics package**

The dbt Semantic Layer supports the calculation of metrics by using the [dbt-metrics package](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt_metrics). This package supports the following primary aggregate metrics:

- Count
- Count distinct
- Average
- Max
- Min
- Sum

Additionally, the dbt-metrics package supports secondary metric calculations including:

- Period over Period changes differences and ratios
- Period to date average, sum, min, and max
- Rolling average, sum, min, and max

The secondary metric calculations use a built-in calendar, which you can use to define time boundaries for weeks, months, and quarters. The default calendar is applicable for many businesses, and users may supply their own calendars if they use non-standard quarters or other time constructs for reporting.

### Design and define metrics

You can define your metrics in `.yml` files nested under a metrics key. To start designing or defining your own metrics in your dbt project, review the following documents to get started:

- [Structuring and designing your metrics](URL) blog to understand best practices for designing and structuring metrics in your dbt project
- [dbt metrics](/docs/building-a-dbt-project/metrics) for in-depth detail on attributes, properties, filters, and how to define and query your metrics
- [dbt Semantic Layer](/docs/integrate/setup-dbt-semantic-layer.md#set-up-dbt-semantic-layer) to learn about the dbt Semantic Layer
- [Getting started with the Semantic Layer](/docs.getdbt.com/blog/getting-started-with-the-dbt-semantic-layer) blog post to see further examples
