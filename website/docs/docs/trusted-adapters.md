Trusted adapters are adapters not maintained by dbt Labs, that we feel comfortable recommending to users for use in production.

### to be toggle heading'd

Free and open-source tools for the data professional are increasingly abundant. This is by-and-large a *good thing*, however it requires due dilligence that wasn't required in a paid-license, closed-source software world. Before taking a dependency on an open-source projet is is important to determine the answer to the following questions:

1. Does it work?
2. Does anyone "own" the code, or is anyone liable for ensuring it works?
3. Do bugs get fixed quickly?
4. Does it stay up-to-date with new Core features?
5. Is the usage substantial enough to self-sustain?
6. What risks do I take on by taking a dependency on this library?

### Trusted vs Verified

- the guidelines given in the Trusted program,
- formal agreements required for integration with dbt Cloud
