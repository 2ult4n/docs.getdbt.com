The dbt Semantic Layer, powered by MetricFlow, simplifies the process of defining and using critical business metrics, like¬†`revenue` in the modeling layer (your dbt project). By centralizing metric definitions, data teams can ensure consistent self-service access to these metrics in downstream data tools and applications. The dbt Semantic Layer eliminates duplicate coding by allowing you to define metrics on top of existing models and automatically handles data joins. 

Moving metric definitions out of the BI layer and into the modeling layer allows data teams to feel confident that different business units are working from the same metric definitions, regardless of their tool of choice. If a metric definition changes in dbt, it‚Äôs refreshed everywhere it‚Äôs invoked and creates consistency across all applications.

## Explore the dbt Semantic Layer

The dbt Semantic Layer is available to all Team and Enterprise Plans during [public beta](/docs/dbt-versions/release-notes/July-2023/sl-revamp-beta#public-beta). Those on dbt Cloud Developer plans or dbt core users can use MetricFlow for defining and testing metrics locally. Start exploring the dbt Semantic Layer by visiting the following pages:

The dbt Semantic Layer allows data teams to centrally define essential business metrics like¬†`revenue`,¬†`customer`, and `churn` in the modeling layer (your dbt project) for consistent self-service within downstream data tools like BI and metadata management solutions. The dbt Semantic Layer provides the flexibility to define metrics on top of your existing models and then query those metrics and models in your analysis tools of choice.

The result? You have less duplicate coding for data teams and more consistency for data consumers. 

The dbt Semantic Layer has four main parts:

- Define your metrics in version-controlled dbt project code using MetricFlow 
	* dbt_metrics is now deprecated
- Import your metric definitions via the [Discovery API](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/discovery-api)
- Query your metric data via the dbt Proxy Server
- Explore and analyze dbt metrics in downstream tools

### What makes the dbt Semantic Layer different?

The dbt Semantic Layer reduces code duplication and inconsistency regarding your business metrics. By moving metric definitions out of the BI layer and into the modeling layer, data teams can feel confident that different business units are working from the same metric definitions, regardless of their tool of choice. If a metric definition changes in dbt, it‚Äôs refreshed everywhere it‚Äôs invoked and creates consistency across all applications. You can also use the dbt Semantic Layer to query models and use macros.

## Manage metrics

:::info üìå

New to dbt or metrics? Check out our [quickstart guide](/quickstarts) to build your first dbt project! If you'd like to define your first metrics, try our [Jaffle Shop](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop_metrics) example project.

:::

If you're not sure whether to define a metric in dbt or not, ask yourself the following: 

> *Is this something our teams consistently need to report on?*  

An important business metric should be:

- Well-defined (the definition is agreed upon throughout the entire organization)
- Time-bound (able to be compared across time)

A great example of this is **revenue** &mdash; it can be aggregated on multiple levels (weekly, monthly, etc) and is key for the broader business to understand.

- ‚úÖ `Monthly recurring revenue` or `Weekly active users` or `Average order value` 
- ‚ùå `1-off experimental metric`


### Design and define metrics

**Design metrics**
To read about best practices on structuring and organizing your metrics, review our [How to design and structure dbt metrics: Recommendations for getting started](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/how-to-design-and-structure-metrics) blog post first.

**Define metrics**
You can define your metrics in `.yml` files nested under a metrics key and to design or define your own metrics in your dbt project, review the following documents: <br />

- [How to design and structure dbt metrics: Recommendations for getting started](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/how-to-design-and-structure-metrics) blog to understand best practices for designing and structuring metrics in your dbt project
- [dbt metrics](docs/build/metrics) for in-depth detail on attributes, filters, how to define and query your metrics, and [dbt-metrics package](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt_metrics)
- [dbt Semantic Layer quickstart](/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/quickstart-semantic-layer) to get started
- [Understanding the components of the dbt Semantic Layer](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/understanding-the-components-of-the-dbt-semantic-layer) blog post to see further examples

  <summary>How are you storing my data?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>The dbt Semantic Layer does not store, or cache, or log your data. On each query to the Semantic Layer, the resulting data passes through dbt Cloud servers where it is never stored, cached, or logged. The data from your data platform gets routed through dbt Cloud servers, to your connecting data tool.</div>

<details>
  <summary>Is the dbt Semantic Layer open source?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>Some components of the dbt Semantic Layer are open source like dbt-core, the dbt_metrics package, and the BSL-licensed dbt-server. The dbt Proxy Server (what is actually compiling the dbt code) and the Discovery API are not open sources. <br></br><br></br>
      
During Public Preview, the dbt Semantic Layer is open to all dbt Cloud tiers (Developer, Team, and Enterprise).<br></br><br></br>

<ul>
<li>dbt Core users can define metrics in their dbt Core projects and calculate them using macros from the metrics package. To use the dbt Semantic Layer integrations, users will need to have a dbt Cloud account.</li><br></br>
<li>Developer accounts will be able to query the Proxy Server using SQL, but will not be able to browse pre-populated dbt metrics in external tools, which requires access to the Discovery API.</li><br></br>
<li>Team and Enterprise accounts will be able to set up the Semantic Layer and Discovery API in the integrated partner tool to import metric definition.</li>
