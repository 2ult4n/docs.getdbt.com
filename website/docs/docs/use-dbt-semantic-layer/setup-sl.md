With the dbt Semantic Layer, you'll be able to centrally define business metrics, reduce code duplication and inconsistency, create self-service in downstream tools, and more. Configure the dbt Semantic Layer in dbt Cloud to connect with your integrated partner tool. 

## Prerequisites

Before you set up the dbt Semantic Layer, make sure you meet the following:

import SetUp from '/snippets/_v2-sl-prerequisites.md';

<SetUp />


<Snippet src="sl-considerations-banner" />


## Set up dbt Semantic Layer

You can set up the dbt Semantic Layer in dbt Cloud at the environment and  project level by following these steps:

1. Create new [deployment environment](/docs/deploy/deploy-environments#create-a-deployment-environment) or use an existing environment on dbt 1.6 or higher.
2. Navigate to **Account Settings** and select the specific project you want to enable the Semantic Layer for.
3. In the **Project Details** page, navigate to **Configure Semantic Layer**.
4. Enter the credentials you want the Semantic Layer to use specific to your data platform. 
    * Note: We recommend using a less privileged set of credentials because your Semantic Layer users will be querying it in downstream applications. At a minimum, the Semantic Layer needs to have read access to the schema(s) that contains the dbt models that you used to build your semantic models.
5. Select the deployment environment you want for the Semantic Layer
6. Next, go back to the **Project Details** page and select **Generate Service Token** to create a Semantic Layer service token. 
7. Save & copy your environment ID, service token, and host for inputting into a downstream tool
8. Youâ€™ve configured the semantic layer ðŸŽ‰! You can now define your [semantic models and metrics](/docs/build/build-metrics-intro) in your project.

:::tip
If you're using the legacy Semantic Layer, we **highly** recommend you [upgrade your dbt version](/docs/dbt-versions/upgrade-core-in-cloud) to dbt v1.6 or higher to use the new dbt Semantic Layer. Refer to the dedicated [migration guide](/guides/migration/sl-migration) for more info.
:::

<!--
1. Create a new environment in dbt Cloud by selecting **Deploy** and then **Environments**.
2. Select **dbt Version 1.6** (or the latest) and enter your deployment credentials.
3. To configure the new Semantic Layer, you must have a successful run in your new environment. We recommend running `dbt ls` since `dbt build` wonâ€™t succeed until youâ€™ve created and defined semantic models and metrics.
4. To enable the dbt Semantic Layer, go to the **Account Settings** page and then select the specific project you want to enable the Semantic Layer for.
5. In the **Project Details** page, select **Configure Semantic Layer.** This will prompt you to enter data platform connection credentials for the Semantic Layer and select the environment where you want to enable the Semantic Layer. We recommend using a less privileged set of credentials when setting up your connection. The semantic layer requires SELECT and CREATE TABLE permissions.
6. After youâ€™ve entered your credentials, you should see a **JDBC URL** connection string. Copy this string and save it in your password manager. This can be used to connect to the semantic layer JDBC.
7. Next, go back to the **Project Details** page and select **Generate Service Token** to create a Semantic Layer service token. Save this token for later.
8. Youâ€™re done ðŸŽ‰! The semantic layer should is now enabled for your project.

With the dbt Semantic Layer, you'll be able to centrally define business metrics, reduce code duplication and inconsistency, create self-service in downstream tools, and more. Configure the dbt Semantic Layer in dbt Cloud to connect with your integrated partner tool. 

## Prerequisites

Before you set up the dbt Semantic Layer, make sure you meet the following:

<Snippet src="sl-prerequisites" />


<Snippet src="sl-considerations-banner" />


## Set up dbt Semantic Layer

If you're using the legacy Semantic Layer, we **highly** recommend you [upgrade your dbt version](/docs/dbt-versions/upgrade-core-in-cloud) to dbt v1.6 or higher to use the new dbt Semantic Layer. Refer to the dedicated [migration guide](/guides/migration/sl-migration) for more info.

Before you continue with the following steps, you **must** have a multi-tenant dbt Cloud account hosted in North America. 
 * Team and Enterprise accounts can set up the Semantic Layer and [Discovery API](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/discovery-api) in the integrated partner tool to import metric definitions. 
 * Developer accounts can query the Proxy Server using SQL but won't be able to browse dbt metrics in external tools, which requires access to the Discovery API.

You can set up the dbt Semantic Layer in dbt Cloud at the environment level by following these steps:

1. Login to your dbt Cloud account
2. Go to **Account Settings**, and then **Service Tokens** to create a new [service account API token](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/service-tokens). Save your token somewhere safe. 
3. Assign permissions to service account tokens depending on the integration tool you choose. You can review the [integration partner documentation](https://www.getdbt.com/product/semantic-layer-integrations) to determine the permission sets you need to assign.
4. Go to **Deploy** and then **Environment**, and select your **Deployment** environment.
5. Click on **Settings** on the top right side of the page.
6. Click **Edit** on the top right side of the page.
7. Select dbt version 1.2 or higher.
8. Toggle the Semantic Layer **On**.
9. Copy the full proxy server URL (like `https://eagle-hqya7.proxy.cloud.getdbt.com`) to connect to your [integrated partner tool](https://www.getdbt.com/product/semantic-layer-integrations). 
10. Use the URL in the data source configuration of the integrated partner tool.
11. Use the data platform login credentials that make sense for how the data is consumed.

:::infoðŸ“Œ 

Note  - It is _not_ recommended that you use your dbt Cloud credentials due to elevated permissions. Instead, you can use your specific integration tool permissions.

:::

12. Set up the [Discovery API](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/discovery-api) (Team and Enterprise accounts only) in the integrated partner tool to import the metric definitions. The [integrated partner tool](https://www.getdbt.com/product/semantic-layer-integrations) will treat the dbt Server as another data source (like a data platform). This requires:

- The account ID, environment ID, and job ID (visible in the job URL)
- An [API service token](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/service-tokens) with job admin and metadata permissions
- Add the items above to the relevant fields in your integration tool
