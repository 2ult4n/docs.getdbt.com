If you would like to change your account's credit card details, the account owner can do this by clicking the gear icon in the upper right corner and going to Account Settings  &#8594; Billing  &#8594; Payment Information. From there, click the Edit button in the upper right corner of the Payment Information section to input the new credit card details. 

To change your billing name or address, just send us a message at support@getdbt.com with the newly updated information, and we can make that change for you!
