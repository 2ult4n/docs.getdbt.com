This article outlines the steps for changing the license type for a user from `developer` to `read-only` in dbt Cloud. This is frequently done to free up a billable seat but retain the userâ€™s access to view the information in the dbt Cloud account. You must be an account owner/admin to perform these actions.

1. From dbt Cloud, click the gear icon at the top right and select **Account Settings**.

3. Select the user you want to remove, and click **Edit** in the bottom of their profile.
4. Under License, change from "Developer" to "Read-only", and click **Save**.
