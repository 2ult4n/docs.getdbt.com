2. From the left side menu, expand **Teams** and select **Users**
3. Select the user you would like to delete, then select **Edit** at the bottom of the information pane. 
4. Choose the **Delete** option and then confirm the action to complete the deletion.
 * Note that there will be no account password prompt and the user will be deleted immediately after confirmation. Once you delete a user, this action cannot be undone. However, you can re-invite a user with the same information if the deletion was in error.
