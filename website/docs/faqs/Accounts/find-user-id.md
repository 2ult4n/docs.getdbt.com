You may need to find your user-id to rotate your API token, and so on. Refer to the following steps if you need to find your `user-id` in dbt Cloud:

1. Go to **Account Settings**, **Team**, and then **Users**,
2. Select your user, <br />
3. In the address bar, copy the number after `/users`. <br />

In the example URL `https://cloud.getdbt.com/next/settings/accounts/12345/users/67891`, the `user-id` is `67891`<br /><br />
