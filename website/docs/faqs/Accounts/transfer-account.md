Depending on your account plan, review the steps below if you want to transfer [access control](/docs/collaborate/manage-access/about-access) to another user.

| Account plan| Steps |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **Developer** |  You can transfer ownership by changing the email directly on your [Profile page](https://cloud.getdbt.com/#/profile/).|
| **Team** | Existing account admins with account access can add or remove users to the owner group.
| **Enterprise** | Account admins can add or remove users to a group with Account Admin permissions. |
| **If all account owners left the company** | If the account owner has left your organization, you will need to work with your IT department to have incoming emails forwarded to a new person. Once you have redirected the email, you can request to reset the user password and once logged in - you can change the email on the [Profile page](https://cloud.getdbt.com/#/profile/). |
