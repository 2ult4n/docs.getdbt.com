If you would like to transfer your account ownership to another user, take a look at the steps below:
 
- **For Developer Plans**: 
  - You can transfer ownership by changing the email directly on your [Profile page](https://cloud.getdbt.com/#/profile/)

- **For Teams and Enterprise Plans**:  An existing account admin with account access is able to log in and add/remove users to the owner group. 
  -   In Enterprise plan tier accounts, account admins can add/remove users to a group with Account Admin permissions

- **If all Account Owners have left the company**: 
  -  If the account owner has left your organization, you will need to work with your IT department to have incoming email forwarded to a new person. Once you have redirected the email, you can request to reset the user password and once logged in - you can change the email on your [Profile page](https://cloud.getdbt.com/#/profile/)
