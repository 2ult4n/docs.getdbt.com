See the steps below to transfer [access control](docs/dbt-cloud/access-control/access-control-overview) to another user, depending on your plan. If you're seeing any issues, reach out to the Support team at support@getdbt.com and we'll be happy to help!

| Plan| Action |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Developer |  You can transfer ownership by changing the email directly on your [Profile page](https://cloud.getdbt.com/#/profile/).|
| Teams | Existing account admins with account access can add or remove users to the owner group.
| Enterprise | Account admins can add or remove users to a group with Account Admin permissions. |
| If all account owners left the company | If the account owner has left your organization, you will need to work with your IT department to have incoming emails forwarded to a new person. Once you have redirected the email, you can request to reset the user password and once logged in - you can change the email on the [Profile page](https://cloud.getdbt.com/#/profile/). |
