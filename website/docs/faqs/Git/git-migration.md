If you'd like to migrate from one git provider to another, refer to the following steps to avoid minimal disruption:

1. Outside of dbt Cloud, you'll need to import your existing repo into your new provider. As an example, if you're migrating from GitHub to Azure DevOps, you'll need to import your existing repo (GitHub) into your new git provider (Azure DevOps). 
   
   For detailed steps on how to do this, refer to your git provider's documentation ([GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/migrations/importing-source-code/using-github-importer/importing-a-repository-with-github-importer), [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/import/repo_by_url.html), [Azure DevOps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/import-git-repository?view=azure-devops)) 
   
2. Go back to dbt Cloud and set up the [native integration for the new git provider](/docs/cloud/git/connect-github), if needed. 
3. In dbt Cloud, go to **Account Settings** and then **Projects**  and disconnect the old repo. 
4. On the same page, connect to the new repo.
   - If you're using the native integration, you may need to OAuth to it.
5. That's it, you should now be connected to the new git provider ðŸŽ‰
   Note &mdash; As a tip, we recommend you refresh your page and dbt Cloud IDE before performing any actions.
