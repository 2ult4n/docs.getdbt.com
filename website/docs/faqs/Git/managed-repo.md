We can send your managed repository through a zip file in its current state for you to push up to a git provider. After that, you'd just need to switch over the repo in your [Project](/docs/dbt-cloud/cloud-configuring-dbt-cloud/cloud-import-a-project-by-git-url) to point to the new repository.

When you're ready to do this, email our Support team at support@getdbt.com with your request and your managed repo URL, which you can find by navigating to your project setting. To find project settings, click the gear icon to the top right, select **Account settings**, click **Projects**, and then select your project. Under "Repositories" in the project details page, you will find your managed repo URL.
