2. In the **Projects** pane, select the project to delete.  
3. Select the edit icon in the lower right-hand corner. Once in edit mode, a **Delete** option will appear on the left-hand side of the project information pane. 
4. Select **Delete** and then confirm the action.  
  * Note that on the confirmation screen there will be no account password prompt, and the project will be deleted immediately after confirmation.  Once you delete a project, this action cannot be undone.
