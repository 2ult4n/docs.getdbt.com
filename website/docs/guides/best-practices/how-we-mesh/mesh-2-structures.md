## Exploring mesh patterns

Building a dbt Mesh is not a one-size-fits-all process. In fact, it's the opposite! It's about customizing your project structure to fit _your_ team and _your_ data. Often we've had to fit the data team and project structure into our company's org chart, or manage everything in one project to handle the constraints of our data and warehouse. dbt Mesh allows us to mold our organizational knowledge graph to our organizational people graph, bringing people and data closer together rather than compromising one for the other.

## DAG Splitting

The first (and perhaps most difficult!) decision when migrating to a mesh is deciding where to draw the line in your DAG to define the interfaces between the functional areas in your project. Let's explore some language for discussing the design of these patterns.
### Vertical splits

Vertical splits separate out layers of transformation in the DAG order. Let's look at some examples.

- **Splitting up staging and mart layers.** Creating a more tightly-controlled, shared set of components that other projects build on but can't edit.
- **Isolating earlier models for security and governance requirements.** Separating out and masking PII data so that downstream consumers can't access it is a common use case for a vertical split.
- **Protecting complex or expensive data.** If you have a large or complex model that's expensive to run, you might want to isolate it so that it's safer from accidental selection, independently deployable, and easier to debug when it has issues.

### Horizontal splits

Horizonal splits separate your DAG based on source or domain. These splits are often based around the shape and size of the data and how it's used, rather than the security or governance requirements. Let's consider some possibilites for horizontal splitting.

- **Team consumption patterns.** For example, splitting out the marketing team's data flow into a separate project.
- **Data from different sources.** For example, click event data and transactional ecommerce data.
- **Team workflows.** If two embedded groups operate in different project management tools at different paces, or are staffed differently, you may want to split the projects up so they can move independently.

## Combining these divisions

- **These are not either/or techniques**. You should consider both types of divisions, and combine them in any way that makes sense for your organization.
- **Pick one type of split and focus on that first**. If you have a hub-and-spoke team topology for example, handle breaking out the central platform project before you split the remainder into domains. Then if you need to break those domains up horizontally you can focus on that after the fact.
- **DRY applies to underlying data not just code.** Regardless of your splits, you should not be sourcing the same rows and columns into multiple nodes. Working within a mesh structure it becomes increasingly important that we donâ€™t duplicate work, which creates surface area for conflicts and erodes the single source of truth we're trying to create in our dbt project.

## Monorepo vs multi-repo

A dbt Mesh can exist as multiple projects in a single repo (monorepo) or as multiple projects in their own repositories (multi-repo).

- **Monorepos are often easier to get started with**, but can become unwieldy as the number of models and teams grow.
- If you're a **smaller team** looking primarily to speed up and simplify development, a **monorepo** is likely the right choice.
- If you're a **larger team with multiple groups**, and need to decouple projects for security and enablement of different development styles and rhythms, a **multi-repo setup** is your best bet.
