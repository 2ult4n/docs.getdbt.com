## Conclusion

dbt Mesh is a powerful new pattern for data transformation. It helps adapt teams and their data towards each other, rather than making arbitrary decisions based on the constraints of either one. By creating alignment between your people and data flows, developers can move faster, analysts can be more productive, and data consumers can be more confident in the data they use.

You can incrementally adopt the ideas in this guide in your organization as you hit constraints. There's no pressure to adopt this as the _right pattern_ to build with. That said, familiarizing yourself with dbt Mesh concepts and thinking through how they can apply to your organization will help you make better decisions as you grow. We hope this guide has given you a good starting point to do that.
