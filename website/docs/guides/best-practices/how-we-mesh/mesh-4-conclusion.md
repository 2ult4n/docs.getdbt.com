dbt Mesh is a powerful new pattern for data transformation. It helps adapt teams and their data towards each other, rather than making arbitrary decisions based on the constraints of either one. By creating alignment between your people and data flows, developers can move faster, analysts can be more productive, and data consumers can be more confident in the data they use.

It's important to reiterate that you can _incrementally_ adopt the ideas in this guide in your organization as you hit constraints. The collection of features tha enable dbt Mesh work effectively as independent tools, and there's no pressure to adopt this as the _right pattern_ to build with. That said, familiarizing yourself with the tooling and dbt Mesh concepts, as well as thinking through how they can apply to your organization, will help you make better decisions as you grow. We hope this guide has given you a good starting point to do that.
