If you came here from a data platform setup page, it means there either is:

- Setting up the profile is the only action the end-user needs to take on the data platform, or
- The subsequent actions the end-user needs to take are not currently documented

If you'd like to contribute to data platform-specifc configuration information, refer to [Documenting a new adapter](5-documenting-a-new-adapter)
