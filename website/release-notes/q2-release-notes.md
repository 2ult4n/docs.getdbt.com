## dbt Explorer: an upgrade to data discovery

In the days of yore, answering a question about your data platform may have required a bit of cryptography, sifting through possibly-up-to-date documentation in your internal wiki, run logs to figure out when your models were executed, and slacking the data team member with the most tenure. In the past several years, dbt Docs helped centralize the documentation workflow and dramatically improved the documentation process. While useful, dbt Docs only ever provides a single point in time snapshot, and lacks any sense of your platform’s deployment and execution information. dbt Explorer supercharges the docs experience by providing stateful awareness of your data platform, making support and triage of your platform easier than ever — it even proactively lets you know what to focus on to build even higher quality data products!
