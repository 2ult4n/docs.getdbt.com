Starting in 2024, when you select **Keep on latest version** in dbt Cloud, it will ignore version checking. However, if you're not using this configuration, dbt Labs recommends:
- **Writing defensive code** &mdash; If you're developing dbt code that could be run in a variety of execution contexts (such as a package) and you depend on newer dbt functionality, you can add conditional logic that checks for the presence of other packages or macros.
- **Pinning packages** &mdash; If you're maintaining a dbt project that installs third-party packages and are concerned about the potential for breaking changes in those packages, you should pin the package to a specific revision or `version` boundary. Since v1.7, this is the default dbt behavior, by _locking_ the version/revision of packages in development in order to guarantee predictable builds in production.
