Resource-specific configurations are applied to individual dbt resources. They influence specific attributes of the resource, such as [sql-header](/reference/resource-configs/sql_header), [column_types](/reference/resource-configs/column_types), [strategy](/reference/resource-configs/strategy), and so on. You can define these settings in the project file (`dbt_project.yml`), a property file (`models/properties.yml` for models, similarly for other resources), or within the resourceâ€™s file using the `{{ config() }}` macro.
