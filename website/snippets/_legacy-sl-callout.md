:::important Upgrade to access the latest dbt Semantic Layer

The dbt Semantic Layer has undergone a [significant revamp](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-semantic-layer-whats-next/), introducing new features such as dbt Semantic Layer APIs. The APIs integrate with data applications, such as Tableau and Google Sheets, to query metrics and unlock insights.

For users on dbt version 1.5 or earlier, starting on December 15th, 2023, support for dbt Metrics and the old dbt Semantic Layer (v1.5 and below) will end. To benefit from the latest features, upgrade to the most [recent version](/guides/migration/sl-migration) of dbt and embrace the enhanced dbt Semantic Layer, powered by MetricFlow.

After this date, dbt Labs won't offer support, bug fixes, or security updates for these deprecated features. Documentation for them will be discontinued, and they will be removed from the dbt Cloud user interface.
