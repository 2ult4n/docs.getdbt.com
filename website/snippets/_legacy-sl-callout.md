:::important Upgrade to access the latest dbt Semantic Layer

The dbt Semantic Layer has undergone a [significant revamp](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-semantic-layer-whats-next/), introducing new features such as dbt Semantic Layer APIs. The APIs integrate with data applications, such as Tableau and Google Sheets, to query metrics and unlock insights. 

If you're reading this message, you're either using an older version of our documentation or currently use the legacy Semantic Layer. 

As of December 15th, 2023, dbt Metrics and the legacy dbt Semantic Layer (v1.5 and lower) will no longer be supported. To benefit from the latest features, upgrade to the most [recent version](/guides/migration/sl-migration) of dbt and embrace the enhanced dbt Semantic Layer, powered by MetricFlow.

After this date, dbt Labs won't offer support, bug fixes, or security updates for these deprecated features. Documentation for them will be discontinued, and they will be removed from the dbt Cloud user interface.
