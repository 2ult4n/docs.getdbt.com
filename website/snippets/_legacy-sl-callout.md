:::info Upgrade your dbt version to access the new dbt Semantic Layer

The dbt Semantic Layer has undergone a [significant revamp](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-semantic-layer-whats-next/), making it more efficient to define and query metrics. This means the legacy Semantic Layer (dbt v1.5 or lower) is no longer supported and won't receive any code fixes.

**Whatâ€™s changed?** The dbt_metrics package has been [deprecated](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/deprecating-dbt-metrics) and replaced with [MetricFlow](/docs/build/about-metricflow?version=1.6), one of the Semantic Layer's key component and a new way framework for defining metrics in dbt. We also introduce improved governance, enhanced efficiency, data accessibility, and new Semantic Layer APIs.

**Who does this affect?** The new and revamped dbt Semantic Layer is available for users on [Team or Enterprise plans](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing/) using dbt v1.6 or higher. 

**What should you do?** If you're using the legacy Semantic Layer, we **highly** recommend you [upgrade your dbt version](/docs/dbt-versions/upgrade-core-in-cloud) to dbt v1.6 or higher to use the new dbt Semantic Layer. Refer to the dedicated [migration guide](/guides/migration/sl-migration) for more info.

-is this correct? no right?-->
Although you can still use the legacy dbt Semantic Layer using the deprecated dbt_metrics package on v1.5 or older, these versions are no longer supported and won't receive any code fixes.
