:::tip Introducing the new dbt Semantic Layer ðŸŽ‰

The dbt Semantic Layer has undergone a [significant revamp](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-semantic-layer-whats-next/), making it more efficient to define and query metrics. The new dbt Semantic Layer introduces new semantic components, improved governance, enhanced efficiency, data accessibility, and new Semantic Layer APIs. The new dbt Semantic Layer will lay the foundation for effective organization and interaction with data. The dbt Semantic Layer is available to all dbt Cloud plans (Developer, Team, and Enterprise) during [public beta](/docs/dbt-versions/release-notes/06-July-2023/sl-revamp-beta). 

**Whatâ€™s changed?** The dbt_metrics package has been [deprecated](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/deprecating-dbt-metrics) and replaced with [MetricFlow](/docs/build/about-metricflow?version=1.6), one of the Semantic Layer's key component and a new way framework for defining metrics in dbt.
