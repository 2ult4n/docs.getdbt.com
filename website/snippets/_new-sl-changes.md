:::tip Introducing the new dbt Semantic Layer ðŸŽ‰

The dbt Semantic Layer has undergone a [significant revamp](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-semantic-layer-whats-next/), making it more efficient to define and query metrics. The new dbt Semantic Layer is in [public beta](/docs/dbt-versions/release-notes/July-2023/sl-revamp-beta#public-beta) and available open to all dbt Cloud plans. It introduces new semantic components, improved governance, enhanced efficiency, data accessibility, and new Semantic Layer APIs. 

**Whatâ€™s changed?** The dbt_metrics package has been [deprecated](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/deprecating-dbt-metrics) and replaced with [MetricFlow](/docs/build/about-metricflow?version=1.6), one of the Semantic Layer's key component and a new way framework for defining metrics in dbt.
