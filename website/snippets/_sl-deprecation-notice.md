:::info Deprecation of dbt Metrics and the legacy dbt Semantic Layer
For users on dbt version 1.5 or earlier &mdash; starting on December 15th, 2023, support for dbt Metrics and the old dbt Semantic Layer (v1.5 and below) will end. To benefit from the latest features, upgrade to the most [recent version](/guides/migration/sl-migration) of dbt and embrace the enhanced dbt Semantic Layer, powered by MetricFlow.

After December 15th, dbt Labs will no longer support these deprecated features, they will be removed from the dbt Cloud user interface, and their documentation removed from the docs site.
