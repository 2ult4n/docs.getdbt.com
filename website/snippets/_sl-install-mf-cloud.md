This step is for dbt Cloud CLI users only (dbt Cloud IDE support coming soon). 

dbt Cloud CLI users must install [MetricFlow dbt Cloud](/docs/build/metricflow-cloud) to run MetricFlow commands. It's compatible with Python versions 3.8, 3.9, 3.10 and 3.11:

1. Make sure you've installed the [dbt Cloud CLI](/docs/cloud/cloud-cli-installation)
2. Create or activate your virtual environment. `python -m venv venv` or `source your-venv/bin/activate`
3. Run `pip install metricflow`
