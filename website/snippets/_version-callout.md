:::info Model versioning is different to a version tag

Take note that a [version tag](/reference/project-configs/version) (or `version`) is different to [`versions`](/reference/resource-properties/versions) or [Model versions](/docs/collaborate/govern/model-versions). A version tag refers to the compatibility of the dbt project with a specific version of dbt. A version tag isn't required for dbt v1.5 and higher. 

Model versions and `versions` are _features_ that enable better governance and data model management by allowing you to track changes and updates to models over time.  Model versions and `versions` are available in dbt v1.5 or higher.
