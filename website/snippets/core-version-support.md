- **[Active](/docs/dbt-versions/core#ongoing-patches)** &mdash; We will patch regressions, new bugs, and include fixes for older bugs / quality-of-life improvements. We implement these changes when we have high confidence that they're narrowly scoped and won't cause unintended side effects.
- **[Critical](/docs/dbt-versions/core#ongoing-patches)** &mdash; Newer minor versions transition the previous minor version into "Critical Support" with limited "security" releases for critical security and installation fixes.
- **[End of Life](/docs/dbt-versions/core#eol-version-support)** &mdash; Minor versions that have reached EOL no longer receive new patch releases. If there's an issue with dependencies, we address this within dbt Cloud rather than through a new patch release. All dbt Core v1.0 and later are available in dbt Cloud until further notice. 
- **Deprecated** &mdash; dbt-core versions older than v1.0 are no longer maintained by dbt Labs, nor supported in dbt Cloud.
