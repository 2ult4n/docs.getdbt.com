:::info Deprecation of dbt Metrics and the legacy dbt Semantic Layer
If you're reading this message, you're either using an older version of our documentation or currently use the legacy Semantic Layer.

As of December 15th, 2023, dbt Metrics and the legacy dbt Semantic Layer (v1.5 and lower) will no longer be supported. To benefit from the latest features, upgrade to the most [recent version](/guides/migration/sl-migration) of dbt and embrace the enhanced dbt Semantic Layer, powered by MetricFlow.

After this date, dbt Labs won't offer support, bug fixes, or security updates for these deprecated features. Documentation for them will be discontinued, and they will be removed from the dbt Cloud user interface.
